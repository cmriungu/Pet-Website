      A brief description of Odin:
      <ol>
        <li>Height: 5.5 meters.</li>
        <li>Weight: 700 Kgs.</li>
        <li>Favourite food: Acacia plant.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <P>Last week, he got called to perform at the mayor's daughter's 10th birthday.
      It was all fun until he ran out of the coumpound gates while she was still on his back.
      The look on the faces of all the people, as much as it was funny, displayed fear beyond words.
      The first thing that happened was that fingers were pointed at me. People begun asking me what 
      should be done and how we get Odin back. 
      <br>
      As sure as I was that Odin would just run around the compound then return, it was difficult to 
      keep calm in the fracas that had begun.
