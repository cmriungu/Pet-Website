    <p>Odin likes adventure just as much as I do (or maybe more). 
      Lately during our adventures, I have realised he runs quickly ahead of me, 
      I think it's just to get attention from this bird he likes, 
      though he furiously denies it.</p>

    <P>Last week, he got called to perform at the mayor's daughter's 10th birthday.
      It was all fun until he ran out of the coumpound gates while she was still on his back....
